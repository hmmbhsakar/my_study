1. Day Wasted in Political Twitter + Youtube

## 2025/10/10

1. Did started and studied ADK, but I don't remember much as I had just watched the videos on ADK, till very late. 


## 2025/10/09

1. Today Starting Agent Development Kit by Google. Target Properly completely it. Build Some Unique thing with it. I haven't Decided yet on what to build. Let's see might decide in the way. 
2. Today not did much on ADK, kept learning the bash, uv, and that's it. Tomorrow hopefully would start the ADK in first half itself. 

## 2025/10/08

1. The same can be said about today as yesterday, worked on office work, but didn't worked much on this learning and stuff. Tomorrow would be different for sure. Pardon me future self for today.

## 2025/10/07

1. Couldn't do much on working side, reason being some family work in depth research all. Worked on work laptop regarding some office work. Health also some what down side, now well, would be productive stream tomorrow.

## 2025/10/06

1. Monday starts, means office also in picture, worked whole day along with Gym. Working on a unique tool, which will share in future on my GitHub. Tool to automate Mail sending without using costly APIs, kind of using selenium to send mails in batch
2. Since not worked on this repo or system, so nothing to commit here. But learnt a lot on selenium especially. 

## 2025/10/05

1. Downloaded ffmpeg to create a new Study with me, a combined one for study stream audio merger
2. On study part mostly did on the repo only, learnt a lot of things, those all are part of this repo.
3. 3-4 hours leak happened because of some personal reasons
4. still the tasks written in to-do is in pending stage. but would soon complete them, as a lot of things are getting done and have properly been able to properly note down the same as well.

## 2025/10/04

1. Further kept on regarding ChatGPT suggestion on addition of POSIX, which eventually lead to learning a lot of new things, for which on 3rd Oct also and today added in the respective folders.
2. The categorization is getting somewhat out of hand, as whatever new thing I am finding, I am adding in the ultimate structure leading to too much categorization. Like in virtualization only I would have added 10 category. And since had used the gemini Google Search for coming up with the category of the virtualization so possibly it might not be best as I think Google Search AI is the lightest and fastest inference model of the Google
3. After stopping the Categorization and that pursuit, started working on a old project in work laptop to automate the mailer in batch using selenium and python. Although it took time but output is much better than giving task completely to AI and asking it build the whole source code as many thing unnecessary is also added by llms, many things fail. Hence toward started with the approach of bottom to top, started very least basic feature like opening a url in browser using selenium and kept on adding elements sequentially. Found that find by XPATH is a lot great in performing and very easy to detect.
4. Work Laptop was full of waste, 10s of projects with virtual environment taking 10s of GB space and internal full, and since changing project so deleted every project's virtual environment and node modules. Even removed ~2000 mails from inbox. Cleaned directories. Since out of old project so found that every access is automatically gone, like even websites whose special access had in earlier project are now blocked
5. Checked that got allocated in new project, since new project's client is google so somewhat excited to start the journey.  

## 2025/10/03

1. Created Multiple files and started working through them, mostly forgot to push in night, so don't even recall much what i did most of the time, but since in morning of 4th oct, first pushed the commit till 3rd so can check through it. 

## 2025/10/02

1. Since I have work laptop of office, was thinking how can i utilize the same to for learning and productivity, like just using the display of laptop as the another monitor, that way I would have one more display to work with. Found that Window has a inbuilt method Projecting to This PC for doing the same in laptop with Miracast compatibility, but that requires "Wireless Display" optional feature to be enabled and this enablement requires admin privileges. 
2. Failing on the same, started searching for software level work on the same. Found one open source software named: Deskreen but it was not updated since 2022 and also on installation it couldn't detect the wifi laptop is connected with cast the screen over local network
3. Trying ahead, I thought to try Spacedesk, but the issue is it's viewer also need admin access for installation. Hence attempt failed
4. Little customized the Screen being casted on the Youtube Stream. Like Interesting way to make only the windows visible and not the background without anything. Using Chroma and color combination.  
5. Started with organization of the tools whoes notes already was working on like wsl, shell. But then to save the notes of the OBS, it felt issue as which category to keep it in. And that'w how improvement of the 3 years old tools categorization began which eventually using multiple llms like chatgpt, grok, gemini, claude (best) became most organized at the same time a lot larger comprehensive and full of tools never even heard of. But since this effort is one time and then it would be streamlined to learn and write notes of any tools in this repo hence did it. Actually whole day's most time went into the same. Now still one time cross-verification from the chatgpt generated tools list is pending.  
6. Today can't be much considered studying but still, since few days back only started so this is somewhat expected, hope that after this when the real study starts then also I can continue the same streak and keep doing the same and complete everything properly. 

## 2025/10/01

1. Started from Mid day like 1 Pm, as today is the first day when unallocated
2. Configured wsl like understood that the default terminal emulator of Ubuntu in case of WSL isn't GNOME but instead of zutty, not much information on the same were available online. But finding the official website was helpful to understand.
3. Understood the difference between multiple things like one being Terminal vs Terminal Emulator, Shell vs CLI, sudo apt vs sudo snap
4. Understood multiple things of daily operations like shortcuts to use window terminal, vs code and such for smooth operation. Like creating new terminal using the command pallet of the terminal.
5. Found one unique finding that typing bash in cmd will lead to starting of the WSL, but doing the same in the git-bash terminal would lead to nothing as the git-bash terminal is itself a bash and the bash.exe binary in the git directory might be getting priority referenced instead of the bash from wsl.
6. Understood that using one terminal lets say git-bash we can work across many shell like to cmd, powershell, bash(wsl). As just enter the mode wanted like "wsl" or "powershell" or "cmd" and then when done just enter exit to logout from the recent mode. Let's say once you enter the powershell and then from powershell prompt you enter the cmd then exit button at first would just exit the cmd and then again exit would exit the powershell. Kind of nested shell session.
7. Wasn't able to open the git-bash in the same window of the cmd.
8. Learnt multiple ways to open file in default program from git-bash and ubuntu
